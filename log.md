# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a stone-paper-scissor python game basic. Also started my own blog on programming and my learnings. Will be ready with the first blog in 2 days.

**Thoughts:** I felt confident by writing the whole program with very little help from internet. I think practicing more programs along with writing workflows will help me a lot.

### Day 1: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about datastructures and algorithm - binary search, selection sort, linked lists and arrays. I am also trying on making a game with pygame module - "Space Invaders". I also coded on hackerrank and codechef.

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with remembering syntaxes and functions. Trying to learn pygame featurers.

### Day 3: August 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt Breadth First Search Algorithm, queue data structure and Djkistra's algorithm. I also made a progress on my game of space invaders. Tweaking with some game progam to learn new attributes. 

**Thoughts** It hard to use a high level editor such as subline text editor for beginners and so I jumped to Pycharm editor which is robust and easy to use. Hopefully by tomorrow i will finish building my game.

### Day 4: August 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learnt greedy alogrithms and how to approximate NP problems with approximation algorithm. I als implemented it with code. My progress on game is almost near to completion. 

**Thoughts** Coding everyday has helped to me think on more projects and remember useful algorithms and functions. Practicing code daily has made it a second nature in my routine. I have startedd to develop more interest in computer sciences.

### Day 5: August 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learnt dynamic programming and how can it be implemented in our programs. I also learnt how is K-nearest neighbor algorithm so simple and versatile. I am happy to finish my space invaders game. It is my first take on games and I learnt a lot. I have not created the game myself but i enjoyed the process of programming. Looking forward to make my own game. 

**Thoughts** I have learnt so far that if we don't code daily, we will tend to forget the functions and methods if we are in a beginner phase. So coding everyday is a must thing.

### Day 6: August 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I started my course on algorithm and data structures on coursera. I have also started a new game to practice though not my own, I have taken up to get more practice and learn new concepts.  

**Thoughts** The jounrey of self teaching programming is a tough path but its worth every drop of sweat. There have been tonnes of blockades on my journey but facing the challenges and finding the solution is what is have learnt so far.

### Day 7: August 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I started my course on algorithm and data structures on coursera. I have also started a new game to practice though not my own, I have taken up to get more practice and learn new concepts.  

**Thoughts**: I have started to think with a more robust plan and mindset like a programmer. I want to practice more of programming and learn. I will be advancing my knowledge on alorithms with my coursera course.

### Day 8: August 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learnt the big-O notation and its significance, Euclidean algorithm in my coursera course. I also progressed on my game. By tomorrow I will be able to complete my second game. 

**Thoughts**: There is lot to learn everyday. Being focused everyday has helped me to learn better and keep the momentum going.

### Day 9: August 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt to implement efficient algorithms for GCD and LCM problems as well as many different Fibonacci problems. My game development practice is currently a bit slow but will try finishing it in next 2 days.

**Thoughts**: Finding a right algorithm for a particular problem makes a huge difference. Coding should be a habit not a hobby to become the master of it.

### Day 10: August 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today i learnt about greedy algorithms and its implementation on tricky problems such as car-fueling problem, money-change problem, maximum-salary problem, etcetera. 

**Thoughts**: Finding a right algorithm for a particular problem makes a huge difference. Coding should be a habit not a hobby to become the master of it.

### Day 11: August 29, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today was more of theory focused study rather than practical work. I learnt about Divide and Conquer algoeithms, the math and logic behind it and how to implement for different problems. 

**Thoughts**: Finding a right algorithm for a particular problem makes a huge difference. Coding should be a habit not a hobby to become the master of it.

### Day 12-13: August 30-31, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: In two days I tried to solve divide and conquer problems on binary search, finding closest points, majority elements etcetera. Though I could only write the code for half of the above mentioned problems. it was worth spending hours on it. 

**Thoughts**: Finding a right algorithm for a particular problem makes a huge difference. Coding should be a habit not a hobby to become the master of it. To learn code and master it one needs to learn algorithms and data structures thoroughly.

### Day 14: September 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the divide and conquer algorithm section of my coursera course. I also started to research on my next project. I am thinking of building a workout scheduler or maybe a game. 

**Thoughts**: Programming is like a deep blue ocean, the deeper you dive, more diversity you find. It is hard to keep up with updates in computer science field but I believe this field is one which brings out the best of you.

### Day 15-16-17: September 2-3-4, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I tried completing my dynamic programming assignment but was stuck badly. I need to go back and learn new algorithms in order to be better equipped with relevant tools.  

**Thoughts**: It gets hard as we dive deeper into fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. I will not give up how hard it is. I am also planning to start a new project on workout scheduler app.Hopefully I will figure it out by this week. Will be taking 2 days off from coding due to health reasons but will come back strong !

### Break !!! (2 Days)


### Day 22: September 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I took two days of break from coding. Though I was not totally isolated from coding on those two days but needed some rest. I coded more than 10 questions on hackerank and also learnt about my new programming language learning challenge that is to learn C++.

**Thoughts**: I have been coding continuously since last week and solving numerous challenges. The only thing I have learnt is never give up on problems. Think smart think efficiently.

### Day 23: September 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I have been coding on hackerank from last 3 days extensively. I also have to learn C++ along with #Python now. Today I also solved my data structures assignment but it was damn hard to get me through even single question. Will try my best to solve the assignment by this week.

**Thoughts**: Learning from like minded and experienced people will help me gain momentum in right direction and will also help me stay motivated.
