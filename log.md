# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a stone-paper-scissor python game basic. Also started my own blog on programming and my learnings. Will be ready with the first blog in 2 days.

**Thoughts:** I felt confident by writing the whole program with very little help from internet. I think practicing more programs along with writing workflows will help me a lot.

### Day 1: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about datastructures and algorithm - binary search, selection sort, linked lists and arrays. I am also trying on making a game with pygame module - "Space Invaders". I also coded on hackerrank and codechef.

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with remembering syntaxes and functions. Trying to learn pygame featurers.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
