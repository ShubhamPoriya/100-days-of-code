# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a stone-paper-scissor python game basic. Also started my own blog on programming and my learnings. Will be ready with the first blog in 2 days.

**Thoughts:** I felt confident by writing the whole program with very little help from internet. I think practicing more programs along with writing workflows will help me a lot.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
