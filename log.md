# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a stone-paper-scissor python game basic. Also started my own blog on programming and my learnings. Will be ready with the first blog in 2 days.

**Thoughts:** I felt confident by writing the whole program with very little help from internet. I think practicing more programs along with writing workflows will help me a lot.

### Day 1: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt about datastructures and algorithm - binary search, selection sort, linked lists and arrays. I am also trying on making a game with pygame module - "Space Invaders". I also coded on hackerrank and codechef.

**Thoughts**: I really struggle with remembering syntaxes and functions. Trying to learn pygame featurers.

### Day 2: August 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt recursion, quick sort algorithm and hash tables and implemented it with code. Also made a progress on my Game.

**Thoughts** Need to figure out text editor settings so that it runs smoothly. Also I am starting to develop more interest in python program development.

### Day 3: August 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learnt Breadth First Search Algorithm, queue data structure and Djkistra's algorithm. I also made a progress on my game of space invaders. Tweaking with some game progam to learn new attributes. 

**Thoughts** It hard to use a high level editor such as subline text editor for beginners and so I jumped to Pycharm editor which is robust and easy to use. Hopefully by tomorrow i will finish building my game.
